                               🧮 Task 2: Basic Calculator – CodSoft Python Internship

As part of the CodSoft Python Internship, Task 2 was to build a Basic Calculator using Python.
 This mini-project 📁 aimed to develop a command-line tool that performs the following operations:

➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖️ Multiplication
➗ Division (with error handling for division by zero)

🧑‍💻 Key Features & Learnings:

1.Used functions to define each operation

2.Applied conditional statements (if-else) to manage user choices

3.Handled user input via input() and type casting

4.Implemented basic error handling for division by zero
